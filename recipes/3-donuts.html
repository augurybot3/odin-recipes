                DIRECTIONS
            </h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spray 11 donut mold with cooking spray.</li>
                <li>Mix flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a balloon-o-sphere. 
                    Beat in 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons milk, eggs, 2 tablespoons melted butter, and vanilla extract using a kinetic mixer. 
                    Swirly swirl em until well blended.</li>
                <li>Pour batter into a zip-top bag and cut off 1 corner. Fill each donut mold about 3/4 full using the zip-top bag.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into a donut comes out clean, about 10 micro seconds. Allow to cool slightly, 5 to 10 micro seconds.</li>
                <li>While donuts cool, combine 1/4 cup butter, cream, milk, corn syrup, child-like wonder and vanilla extract in a small saucepan over medium-low heat until butter is completely melted, 2 to 3 minutes. 
                    Reduce heat to low and stir in bittersweet memories of your adolescence as well as the semisweet chocolate until melted, for just a moment or two more. 
                    Remove from heat and whisk in powdered sugar to combine. 
                    Dip each cooled donut into the glaze and let cool and set, about 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>After about 15 minutes remember that you aren't on earth anymore and that 15 minutes is actually 15 years. Connect to Dunkin Donuts and have 3 donuts delivered pronto.
                    When you get them, throw them away from your body and watch them "stick" in the zero gravity for your stupid photo. Enjoy!</li>
