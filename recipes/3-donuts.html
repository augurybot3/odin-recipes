        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Fill 11 donut molds with cooking spray, flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and
                    salt together or don't, I don't care.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Beat in 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons milk, eggs, 2 tablespoons melted butter, and vanilla extract using
                    a kinetic mixer. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Swirly swirl em until well blended.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Add Marzetti Old Fashioned Caramel Dip and mix until smooth.
                    On low speed, mix in flour; add egg and vanilla and mix just until blended.
                    Pour cream cheese mixture over baked crust.
                    Arrange apple slices and press them into top of cream cheese layer.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Pour batter into a zip-top bag and cut off 1 corner. Fill each donut mold about 3/4 full using the
                    zip-top bag. CAll your mother!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into a donut comes out clean, about 10 micro
                    seconds. Allow to cool slightly, 5 to 10 micro seconds.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>While donuts cool, combine 1/4 cup butter, cream, milk, corn syrup, child-like wonder and vanilla
                    extract in a small saucepan over medium-low heat until butter is completely melted, 2 to 3 minutes.
                    Reduce heat to low and stir in bittersweet memories of your adolescence as well as the semisweet
                    chocolate until melted, for just a moment or two more.
                    Remove from heat and whisk in powdered sugar to combine.
                    Dip each cooled donut into the glaze and let cool and set, about 15 hours.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>After about 15 minutes remember that you aren't on earth anymore and that 15 hours is actually 15
                    years. Connect to Dunkin Donuts and have 3 donuts delivered pronto.
                    When you get them, throw them away from your body and watch them "stick" in the zero gravity for
                    your stupid photo. Enjoy!</p>
