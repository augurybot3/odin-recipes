I have some experience with html but am finding the wealth of these lessons to be the practice I am getting with both Terminal / Command line interface controls as well as Git and Github.com. Because I am merely following along with the lessons found in the Odin Project, it is difficult to pre-define what the end goal of this project is. Suffice it to say, I will make something wacky and weird as always.
